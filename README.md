# The init()
I decided I wanted to experiment with AI considering it's everywhere including electric toothbrushes (for some reason): https://www.oralb.co.uk/en-gb/product-collections/genius-x)

So here's a repo with configurations to run AI based services through the Docker Container Engine.
I wanted to make this process as smooth as possible should I distro hop and if anyone wants to try out AI related stuff whilst retaining as much *privacy and control over their data* by using their own hardware.

I will update this with different services as I experiment and learn.

Current Services:
- Open-WebUI (with Ollama Integration)
- Automatic1111 StableDiffusion

WIP:
- SearXNG
