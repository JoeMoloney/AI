I decided I wanted to experiment with AI considering it's everywhere including electric toothbrushes (for some reason): https://www.oralb.co.uk/en-gb/product-collections/genius-x)

So here's a repo with configurations to run AI based services through the Docker Container Engine. 
I want to make the process as painless as possible and as close to a one-click solution for anyone to try if they got curious.

I will update this with different services as I try them out.

Current Services:
- Open-WebUI (with Ollama Integration)
- Automatic1111 StableDiffusion

WIP:
- SearXNG (w/ValKey & Caddy)

Hardware Specs:
